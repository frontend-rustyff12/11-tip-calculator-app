## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom tailwind properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through refactoring I learned to better derive state and using a state object rather than individual pieces of state

### Continued development

This would be quite cool to make in react native or to add some more layers of complexity to it, ability to select currency , things like that
